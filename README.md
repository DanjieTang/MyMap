# MyMap
This is my map software developed using C++. It serves as the background for my LinkedIn profile and was created through a collaboration with Fabien, one of my close friends at the University of Toronto.

## Contest 3rd place
This project entered the Courier Problem Contest(A special case of the Traveling Salesman problem) and won third place thanks to the clever use of Simulated Annealing heuristics and parallel programming. The contest consists of more than 80 teams and 74 valid submissions.

## Features that I am extra proud of:
### Progressive Disclosure
Displaying all the information contained in the map simultaneously can overwhelm the user with unnecessary details and result in long refreshing time. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the amount of information presented. Inspired by Google Map, our team came up with a solution that prioritizes the most interesting points to tourism. As the user zooms in, less significant points will gradually appear(Figure 4).
